        <h2 class="home">Tarantulas make great pets!</h2>
        <section>
            <p>There are very many different tarantula (T) species with amazing colors and patterns. 
            They look cool and are usually pretty low effort pets. 
            They just need their enclosure built properly, a water dish, feeding, and occasional misting.
            </p>

        <h2 class="home">Feeding your tarantula</h2>
        <section>
            <p>
            You can feed Ts many different prey items, but please pick food that is adequately sized for your T. 
            This means picking out prey items that are smaller than your tarantula.
            For slings (baby tarantulas) you can feed flightless fruit flies, superworms, mealworms, crickets, and dubia roaches. 
            These prey items can be pre-killed for your slings to avoid injury or death.
            For larger juveniles to adults you can feed superworms, mealworms, crickets, and dubia roaches. 
            Some people choose to feed their large adults mice, lizards, and other small vertebrates, but I feel that this should be avoided.
            It's a terrible way for these animals to die and the tarantula will not be able to consume the entiretly of the prey, 
            which means you'll have to find it and remove it to avoid bacterial issues. 
            </p>
            <p> Please note: You shouldn't leave prey items in with your tarantula if they are not eaten. 
                Insects can attempt to eat your T while it is molting, which could cause injury or even death.
            </p>
        </section>
        <h2 class="home">Please don't handle your Ts</h2>
        <section>
            <p>
                Handling tarantulas can be very stressful for them, plus if they bolt they are extremely easy to lose. 
                One long fall for a tarantula can absolutely be deadly! 
                For some species even a fall a few inches can make their abdomens explode when they hit the ground. 
                Plus, handling tarantula can cause you pain if they flick urticating hairs or if they bite you.
                If you have an old world, their venom is also likely to be quite strong and can cause pain and nausea for extended periods of time. 
                Bites from some of these species could even send you to the Emergency Room, cause allergy-type reactions, or even kill you or someone else if they're very old, very young, or severly health-comprised.
